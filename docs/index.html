		    <p class="grey">I am an enthusiastic, IT specialist in system administration, integration, and automation. With over 14 years of experience, I have built and operated IT infrastructure and systems on-premises and in the cloud, using classic SysOps tools and more recent DevOps technologies. While initially building and maintaining services on hardware machines for internal and external customers, I later worked on migrating similar services into new environments with modern toolchains. In the past years, I&#x27;ve spent more time migrating services into Kubernetes, deployed and orchestrated locally and in the cloud. I have also supported development teams in migrating their services into cloud infrastructure. I enjoy closely following the latest changes in technology and apply this to my duties wherever relevant.</p>
