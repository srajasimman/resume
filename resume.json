    "summary": "I am an enthusiastic, IT specialist in system administration, integration, and automation. With over 14 years of experience, I have built and operated IT infrastructure and systems on-premises and in the cloud, using classic SysOps tools and more recent DevOps technologies. While initially building and maintaining services on hardware machines for internal and external customers, I later worked on migrating similar services into new environments with modern toolchains. In the past years, I've spent more time migrating services into Kubernetes, deployed and orchestrated locally and in the cloud. I have also supported development teams in migrating their services into cloud infrastructure. I enjoy closely following the latest changes in technology and apply this to my duties wherever relevant.",
